            is the protagonist of Disneyâ€¢Pixar's 2009 animated feature film, Up. He is an old and cranky retired helium balloon salesman, and the widower of Ellie Fredricksen.
            He travels to South America with wilderness explorer Russell in order to fulfill a promise that he made to his late wife Ellie. Along the way, 
            meet a talking dog named Dug and encounter a giant bird named Kevin,  who is being hunted by the explorer Charles Muntz , whom Carl had idolized in childhood.

        <h4>Reasons why I admire him:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>He is really creative - he made his house fly using thousands of balloons.</li>
            <li>He is loving - he cares really deeply about the people he loves, that he couldn't forget and let go of
                his wife after she passes away for years.
            </li>
            <li class="highlighted">He learns. When he knows that he has to let go in order to make his wife and himself happy, he is willing to 
                really forgive and let his house stay on the waterfall in South America.
